# Memory Gaming Flash-Cards 1
I try to develop a english word game like "word=meaning" matching.
I realy love this method learning a new word.
You can add a new word and meaning to local storage. 
When you play the game, 10 random words can show with random meaning. And you must match to combination.
If you chooce wrong word and meaning you can see card shaking.
Actualyy I didn't coding something like this before. So my algorithm is not clear.
firstly in my coding skills hard part is when you randomize 10 words in the DOM you have write 10 correct answer word with them
and when you pick one word how to check if second choose correct answer. 
I made a solution for that problem with hard way. 
When I create a english card div with word, I write the answer same div's in data-id. 
So when click the answer, I check "answer and data-id" is matching !
